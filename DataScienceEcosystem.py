# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science
# - List commonly used libraries for Data Science
# - Make a Table with Data Science Tools
# - Do a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and add integers.
# - Make a code that can convert 200 minutes to hours.
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1) Python
# 2) R
# 3) Java

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1) Pandas
# 2) Matplotlib
# 3) Scikit-learn

# |Data Science Tools|

# |Jupyter|
# |R Studio|
# |Apache Spark|

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60
